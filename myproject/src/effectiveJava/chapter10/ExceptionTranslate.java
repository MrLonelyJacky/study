 * the exception translation  two ways:
 * 1.higher exception try catch lower exception and throw higher exception
 * 2.exception chain
 * even though exception translation is better than using throw exception without thinking
 * but u can avoid the exception like in higher floor limit args
 * 限定参数比使用异常转译更好
