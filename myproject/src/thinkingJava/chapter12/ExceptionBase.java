 * the exception handle program like catch
 * mind: catch not like switch it is just execute what matches
 * handle with exception often has two models : terminate\recover
 * terminate means the exception exists then the program ends cannot back
 * recover means u must catch exception and do sth to recover
 * long time we use terminate more  the recover is high coupling
 * we must code to handle with exception and it is hard to maintain
